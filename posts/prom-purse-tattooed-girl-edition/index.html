<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>On this episode&hellip;a group of high school kids get a nice gift on prom night, a woman finds a purse that she lost over 60 years ago, and a little girl gets tatted up like her dad.</p>

<h2 id="first-story">First Story</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/400-kids-say-goodbye-to-waving-granny/">https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/400-kids-say-goodbye-to-waving-granny/</a></p>

<p>Tinney Davidson and her husband moved into their home in Comox, British Columbia in 2007. The house was near a local high school and the two of them used to sit in front of their house and wave to the teenagers on their way to school. Even after her husband passed away, Tinney continued the tradition. In 2016, the local kids actually gave her dozens of Valentine&rsquo;s cards to show their appreciation. At 88-years old now, Davidson has decided to move out of her house. When the local teens heard that the quote-unquote Waving Granny would be leaving, 400 of them gathered on her lawn to so goodbye. Davidson was brought to tears as they gave her hugs and bid her farewell. Check out the video <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=402063130345295">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="second-story">Second Story</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/high-schoolers-praise-man-who-paid-for-their-dinner/">https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/high-schoolers-praise-man-who-paid-for-their-dinner/</a></p>

<p>An unidentified man made prom even more memorable for a group of friends. After the dance was over, eleven teens from Fortuna High School in California went for dinner at the Double D Steak restaurant. When they were getting ready to order, the server explained to them that someone had offered to pay for their meal but there was one caveat: they had to enjoy the meal without their cell phones. All of them happily handed over their phones to the server for safe-keeping and they enjoyed the meal. One of the teens later told her mom that they talked the whole night and it was a blast. Another parent commented on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kim.mckenzieemmons/posts/10217361312972049">Facebook post</a> saying, &ldquo;I am still humbled, proud and excited for these kids! What an amazing man to do such a selfless gesture. I hope Each and every young person at that table took a valuable lesson from it. I’d really like to find this amazing man and thank him myself.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="third-story">Third Story</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.today.com/video/woman-reunites-with-purse-lost-at-high-school-65-years-ago-59180101724">https://www.today.com/video/woman-reunites-with-purse-lost-at-high-school-65-years-ago-59180101724</a></p>

<p>Martha &ldquo;Marty&rdquo; Everett lost a purse when she was in high school, 65 years ago in 1954. Recently, construction crews were rebuilding the school when they found the purse. The black clutch was found in a cabinet and still had Marty&rsquo;s ID in it. The school district put up a post on Facebook about the purse and one of her relatives recognized it. They helped track her down and returned the purse to her. Marty says she was amazed at how well everything was preserved and was surprised to find lipstick, a basketball schedule, and pictures of her classmates. There was also a letter from her high school sweetheart who took her to the prom, who ended up reaching out to her after hearing the story. She&rsquo;s grateful to have the purse back but even more grateful for the trip down memory lane and the ability to connect with old friends.</p>

<h2 id="fourth-story">Fourth Story</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/good-news/3-year-old-girl-battling-cancer-gets-tattoos-to-be-just-like-her-dad/ar-AAARhE0">https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/good-news/3-year-old-girl-battling-cancer-gets-tattoos-to-be-just-like-her-dad/ar-AAARhE0</a></p>

<p>3-year-old Trinity D&rsquo;Autorio loves her dad&rsquo;s tattoos and wants ones like his. She also has neuroblastoma and her parents like to find fun things to do to keep her mind off of the cancer. Her wish to get tattoos became a reality with the help of some local artists from Ink Wolves in Tampa, Florida. Trinity&rsquo;s mom reached out to the tattoo parlor and they were more than happy to help out. They bought some special tattoo pens so that the temporary tattoos would look professional and then visited Trinity for about four hours on their day off. Trinity got tattoos all over her arms and legs, mostly Disney characters like Ariel and Winnie the Pooh, and said it was the best day ever. While the tattoos only lasted about six days, they hired a professional photographer so that the pictures would last forever. Trinity&rsquo;s cancer has spread, but with the help of the tattoos, she&rsquo;s feeling tougher than ever.</p>

<h2 id="fifth-story">Fifth Story</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/good-news/nurse-recorded-comforting-patient-with-touching-rendition-of-amazing-grace/ar-AABoQPi">https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/good-news/nurse-recorded-comforting-patient-with-touching-rendition-of-amazing-grace/ar-AABoQPi</a></p>

<p>Nurse Brittany McArthur went beyond her nursing duties when she sang with one of her patients to comfort her. 87-year-old Nellie Barr has been in the hospital after suffering a health scare. Nurse McArthur had only recently met Barr but that didn&rsquo;t stop the two of them singing a beautiful rendition of Amazing Grace together. McArthur said she really didn&rsquo;t have a reason to do it but that they just picked a song and sang together. McArthur says, &ldquo;Nursing isn&rsquo;t just about the clinical care, it&rsquo;s about caring for the whole person. It is more than just medicine. I want to make a difference and if I can make someone smile even for 10 minutes then that&rsquo;s fine by me.&rdquo; Check out the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/good-news/nurse-recorded-comforting-patient-with-touching-rendition-of-amazing-grace/ar-AABoQPi">video</a>&hellip;and make sure to grab the tissues.</p>
